Experiments about the ACL2023 main conference long paper: [__Consistent Prototype Learning for Few-Shot Continual Relation Extraction__](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.409)

Our experiments consist of two datasets, FewRel and TACRED.

## FewlRel
2-shot: python fewrel_2shot.py

5-shot: python fewrel_5shot.py

10-shot: python fewrel_10shot.py

## TACRED
5-shot: python tacred_5shot.py

10-shot: python tacred_10shot.py
